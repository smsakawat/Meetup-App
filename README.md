#Meetup

Meetup is a simple SPA using React.js and Firebase.I just wanted to recap some core concepts of React while doing this project.Here, I used Firebase for quick database setup.Users can see all the meetups in home page and also user can add meetup to his favourites,as I didn't use any authentication here so everyone can add a new meetup if they want.
